# **How to Safely Store Your Wallet**

---
In the following tutorial, we'll talk about some concepts related to wallets & keys so you can be familiar with them.

- ### **About Keys**

You will be given two kinds of keys: a public key, which functions similar to an email address (you may safely share it with others, enabling you to send and receive payments), and a private key, which is often a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). 

- ### **What is a private key?**

A `private key` is a secret string of letters and numbers that allows you to access and manage your cryptocurrency funds. It is like a password that proves your ownership of your cryptocurrency.

-  ### **About Wallets**

Just like your bank PIN, keeping your private keys safe is important! Store them offline somewhere safe. Some investors keep their private keys on a computer that isn't connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized.

A common misconception in cryptocurrency regarding wallets is that they store tokens. However, a wallet is used to store private keys in an encrypted file to sign transactions. Therefore, wallets don't serve as a storage medium for tokens.

A user builds a transaction object, usually through an interface (`Proxy website`), sends that object to the wallet to be signed (`Anchor Wallet`); the wallet then returns that transaction object with a signature which is then broadcast to the network. When/if the network confirms that the transaction is valid, it is included in a blockchain block.

- ### **Where To Store Private Keys?**

1. **Hardware Wallets:**  Use hardware wallets to keep your private keys safe. A hardware wallet is a flash drive-like device designed specifically for storing your private keys.

2. **Online? AT YOUR OWN RISK!:** It's not recommended to keep private keys online, in the mail, or in the cloud because they are most susceptible to getting hacked there. Many users take screenshots of their private keys, and their photo album is usually synced online. This previous action creates a security risk and is something you should do at your own risk.

3. **Offline Flash drive:** If you don't have a hardware wallet, you can temporarily keep your private keys or seed in an offline flash drive or HDD. But these options are only safe as long as they aren't in the hands of an attacker. 

4. **Paper wallet:** A paper wallet is free and is just a piece of paper that prints the pair of private and public keys on it. 

5. **Memorize it:** It's hard to memorize your private key. 

We hope these insights will help you make the best decision for yourself and also help you secure your private keys.
